Pyraf description:

PyRAF is a command language for running IRAF tasks that is based on the Python scripting language. It gives users the ability to run IRAF tasks in an environment that has all the power and flexibility of Python. PyRAF can be installed along with an existing IRAF installation; users can then choose to run either PyRAF or the IRAF CL.

PyRAF is part of the stsci_python package of astronomical data analysis tools, and is a product of the Science Software Branch at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

If you would like a binary install that contains all of STSCI_PYTHON, Python, Numpy, IRAF, STSDAS, etc, see the Ureka download site at http://ssb.stsci.edu/ureka/ . This software bundle most likely contains a lot of software that you do not need, but it greatly simplifies the installation process. If you choose Ureka, you give up some disk space that goes to waste, but you receive a large savings in time and aggravation.
